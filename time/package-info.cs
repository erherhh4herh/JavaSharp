/// <summary>
/// <para>
/// The main API for dates, times, instants, and durations.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The classes defined here represent the principle date-time concepts,
/// including instants, durations, dates, times, time-zones and periods.
/// They are based on the ISO calendar system, which is the <i>de facto</i> world
/// calendar following the proleptic Gregorian rules.
/// All the classes are immutable and thread-safe.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Each date time instance is composed of fields that are conveniently
/// made available by the APIs.  For lower level access to the fields refer
/// to the {@code java.time.temporal} package.
/// Each class includes support for printing and parsing all manner of dates and times.
/// Refer to the {@code java.time.format} package for customization options.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The {@code java.time.chrono} package contains the calendar neutral API
/// <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate ChronoLocalDate"/>,
/// <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime ChronoLocalDateTime"/>,
/// <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime ChronoZonedDateTime"/> and
/// <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.Era Era"/>.
/// This is intended for use by applications that need to use localized calendars.
/// It is recommended that applications use the ISO-8601 date and time classes from
/// this package across system boundaries, such as to the database or across the network.
/// The calendar neutral API should be reserved for interactions with users.
/// </para>
/// 
/// <h3>Dates and Times</h3>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.Instant"/> is essentially a numeric timestamp.
/// The current Instant can be retrieved from a <seealso cref="java.time.Clock"/>.
/// This is useful for logging and persistence of a point in time
/// and has in the past been associated with storing the result
/// from <seealso cref="java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis()"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.LocalDate"/> stores a date without a time.
/// This stores a date like '2010-12-03' and could be used to store a birthday.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.LocalTime"/> stores a time without a date.
/// This stores a time like '11:30' and could be used to store an opening or closing time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.LocalDateTime"/> stores a date and time.
/// This stores a date-time like '2010-12-03T11:30'.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.ZonedDateTime"/> stores a date and time with a time-zone.
/// This is useful if you want to perform accurate calculations of
/// dates and times taking into account the <seealso cref="java.time.ZoneId"/>, such as 'Europe/Paris'.
/// Where possible, it is recommended to use a simpler class without a time-zone.
/// The widespread use of time-zones tends to add considerable complexity to an application.
/// </para>
/// 
/// <h3>Duration and Period</h3>
/// <para>
/// Beyond dates and times, the API also allows the storage of periods and durations of time.
/// A <seealso cref="java.time.Duration"/> is a simple measure of time along the time-line in nanoseconds.
/// A <seealso cref="java.time.Period"/> expresses an amount of time in units meaningful
/// to humans, such as years or days.
/// </para>
/// 
/// <h3>Additional value types</h3>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.Month"/> stores a month on its own.
/// This stores a single month-of-year in isolation, such as 'DECEMBER'.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.DayOfWeek"/> stores a day-of-week on its own.
/// This stores a single day-of-week in isolation, such as 'TUESDAY'.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.Year"/> stores a year on its own.
/// This stores a single year in isolation, such as '2010'.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.YearMonth"/> stores a year and month without a day or time.
/// This stores a year and month, such as '2010-12' and could be used for a credit card expiry.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.MonthDay"/> stores a month and day without a year or time.
/// This stores a month and day-of-month, such as '--12-03' and
/// could be used to store an annual event like a birthday without storing the year.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.OffsetTime"/> stores a time and offset from UTC without a date.
/// This stores a date like '11:30+01:00'.
/// The <seealso cref="java.time.ZoneOffset ZoneOffset"/> is of the form '+01:00'.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <seealso cref="java.time.OffsetDateTime"/> stores a date and time and offset from UTC.
/// This stores a date-time like '2010-12-03T11:30+01:00'.
/// This is sometimes found in XML messages and other forms of persistence,
/// but contains less information than a full time-zone.
/// </para>
/// 
/// <h3>Package specification</h3>
/// <para>
/// Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface
/// in this package will cause a <seealso cref="java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException"/> to be thrown.
/// The Javadoc "@param" definition is used to summarise the null-behavior.
/// The "@throws {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}" is not explicitly documented in each method.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// All calculations should check for numeric overflow and throw either an <seealso cref="java.lang.ArithmeticException"/>
/// or a <seealso cref="java.time.DateTimeException"/>.
/// </para>
/// 
/// <h3>Design notes (non normative)</h3>
/// <para>
/// The API has been designed to reject null early and to be clear about this behavior.
/// A key exception is any method that takes an object and returns a boolean, for the purpose
/// of checking or validating, will generally return false for null.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The API is designed to be type-safe where reasonable in the main high-level API.
/// Thus, there are separate classes for the distinct concepts of date, time and date-time,
/// plus variants for offset and time-zone.
/// This can seem like a lot of classes, but most applications can begin with just five date/time types.
/// <ul>
/// <li><seealso cref="java.time.Instant"/> - a timestamp</li>
/// <li><seealso cref="java.time.LocalDate"/> - a date without a time, or any reference to an offset or time-zone</li>
/// <li><seealso cref="java.time.LocalTime"/> - a time without a date, or any reference to an offset or time-zone</li>
/// <li><seealso cref="java.time.LocalDateTime"/> - combines date and time, but still without any offset or time-zone</li>
/// <li><seealso cref="java.time.ZonedDateTime"/> - a "full" date-time with time-zone and resolved offset from UTC/Greenwich</li>
/// </ul>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// {@code Instant} is the closest equivalent class to {@code java.util.Date}.
/// {@code ZonedDateTime} is the closest equivalent class to {@code java.util.GregorianCalendar}.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Where possible, applications should use {@code LocalDate}, {@code LocalTime} and {@code LocalDateTime}
/// to better model the domain. For example, a birthday should be stored in a code {@code LocalDate}.
/// Bear in mind that any use of a <seealso cref="java.time.ZoneId time-zone"/>, such as 'Europe/Paris', adds
/// considerable complexity to a calculation.
/// Many applications can be written only using {@code LocalDate}, {@code LocalTime} and {@code Instant},
/// with the time-zone added at the user interface (UI) layer.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The offset-based date-time types {@code OffsetTime} and {@code OffsetDateTime},
/// are intended primarily for use with network protocols and database access.
/// For example, most databases cannot automatically store a time-zone like 'Europe/Paris', but
/// they can store an offset like '+02:00'.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Classes are also provided for the most important sub-parts of a date, including {@code Month},
/// {@code DayOfWeek}, {@code Year}, {@code YearMonth} and {@code MonthDay}.
/// These can be used to model more complex date-time concepts.
/// For example, {@code YearMonth} is useful for representing a credit card expiry.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note that while there are a large number of classes representing different aspects of dates,
/// there are relatively few dealing with different aspects of time.
/// Following type-safety to its logical conclusion would have resulted in classes for
/// hour-minute, hour-minute-second and hour-minute-second-nanosecond.
/// While logically pure, this was not a practical option as it would have almost tripled the
/// number of classes due to the combinations of date and time.
/// Thus, {@code LocalTime} is used for all precisions of time, with zeroes used to imply lower precision.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Following full type-safety to its ultimate conclusion might also argue for a separate class
/// for each field in date-time, such as a class for HourOfDay and another for DayOfMonth.
/// This approach was tried, but was excessively complicated in the Java language, lacking usability.
/// A similar problem occurs with periods.
/// There is a case for a separate class for each period unit, such as a type for Years and a type for Minutes.
/// However, this yields a lot of classes and a problem of type conversion.
/// Thus, the set of date-time types provided is a compromise between purity and practicality.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The API has a relatively large surface area in terms of number of methods.
/// This is made manageable through the use of consistent method prefixes.
/// <ul>
/// <li>{@code of} - static factory method</li>
/// <li>{@code parse} - static factory method focussed on parsing</li>
/// <li>{@code get} - gets the value of something</li>
/// <li>{@code is} - checks if something is true</li>
/// <li>{@code with} - the immutable equivalent of a setter</li>
/// <li>{@code plus} - adds an amount to an object</li>
/// <li>{@code minus} - subtracts an amount from an object</li>
/// <li>{@code to} - converts this object to another type</li>
/// <li>{@code at} - combines this object with another, such as {@code date.atTime(time)}</li>
/// </ul>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Multiple calendar systems is an awkward addition to the design challenges.
/// The first principle is that most users want the standard ISO calendar system.
/// As such, the main classes are ISO-only. The second principle is that most of those that want a
/// non-ISO calendar system want it for user interaction, thus it is a UI localization issue.
/// As such, date and time objects should be held as ISO objects in the data model and persistent
/// storage, only being converted to and from a local calendar for display.
/// The calendar system would be stored separately in the user preferences.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// There are, however, some limited use cases where users believe they need to store and use
/// dates in arbitrary calendar systems throughout the application.
/// This is supported by <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate"/>, however it is vital to read
/// all the associated warnings in the Javadoc of that interface before using it.
/// In summary, applications that require general interoperation between multiple calendar systems
/// typically need to be written in a very different way to those only using the ISO calendar,
/// thus most applications should just use ISO and avoid {@code ChronoLocalDate}.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The API is also designed for user extensibility, as there are many ways of calculating time.
/// The <seealso cref="java.time.temporal.TemporalField field"/> and <seealso cref="java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit unit"/>
/// API, accessed via <seealso cref="java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor TemporalAccessor"/> and
/// <seealso cref="java.time.temporal.Temporal Temporal"/> provide considerable flexibility to applications.
/// In addition, the <seealso cref="java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery TemporalQuery"/> and
/// <seealso cref="java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster TemporalAdjuster"/> interfaces provide day-to-day
/// power, allowing code to read close to business requirements:
/// </para>
/// <pre>
///   LocalDate customerBirthday = customer.loadBirthdayFromDatabase();
///   LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
///   if (customerBirthday.equals(today)) {
///     LocalDate specialOfferExpiryDate = today.plusWeeks(2).with(next(FRIDAY));
///     customer.sendBirthdaySpecialOffer(specialOfferExpiryDate);
///   }
/// 
/// </pre>
