	/// <summary>
	/// The DGC abstraction is used for the server side of the distributed
	/// garbage collection algorithm. This interface contains the two
	/// methods: dirty and clean. A dirty call is made when a remote
	/// reference is unmarshaled in a client (the client is indicated by
	/// its VMID). A corresponding clean call is made when no more
	/// references to the remote reference exist in the client. A failed
	/// dirty call must schedule a strong clean call so that the call's
	/// sequence number can be retained in order to detect future calls
	/// received out of order by the distributed garbage collector.
	/// 
	/// A reference to a remote object is leased for a period of time by
	/// the client holding the reference. The lease period starts when the
	/// dirty call is received. It is the client's responsibility to renew
	/// the leases, by making additional dirty calls, on the remote
	/// references it holds before such leases expire. If the client does
	/// not renew the lease before it expires, the distributed garbage
	/// collector assumes that the remote object is no longer referenced by
	/// that client.

		/// The dirty call requests leases for the remote object references
		/// associated with the object identifiers contained in the array
		/// 'ids'. The 'lease' contains a client's unique VM identifier (VMID)
		/// and a requested lease period. For each remote object exported
		/// in the local VM, the garbage collector maintains a reference
		/// list-a list of clients that hold references to it. If the lease
		/// is granted, the garbage collector adds the client's VMID to the
		/// reference list for each remote object indicated in 'ids'. The
		/// 'sequenceNum' parameter is a sequence number that is used to
		/// detect and discard late calls to the garbage collector. The
		/// sequence number should always increase for each subsequent call
		/// to the garbage collector.
		/// 
		/// Some clients are unable to generate a VMID, since a VMID is a
		/// universally unique identifier that contains a host address
		/// which some clients are unable to obtain due to security
		/// restrictions. In this case, a client can use a VMID of null,
		/// and the distributed garbage collector will assign a VMID for
		/// the client.
		/// 
		/// The dirty call returns a Lease object that contains the VMID
		/// used and the lease period granted for the remote references (a
		/// server may decide to grant a smaller lease period than the
		/// client requests). A client must use the VMID the garbage
		/// collector uses in order to make corresponding clean calls when
		/// the client drops remote object references.
		/// 
		/// A client VM need only make one initial dirty call for each
		/// remote reference referenced in the VM (even if it has multiple
		/// references to the same remote object). The client must also
		/// make a dirty call to renew leases on remote references before
		/// such leases expire. When the client no longer has any
		/// references to a specific remote object, it must schedule a
		/// clean call for the object ID associated with the reference.
