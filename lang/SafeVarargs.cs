	/// <summary>
	/// A programmer assertion that the body of the annotated method or
	/// constructor does not perform potentially unsafe operations on its
	/// varargs parameter.  Applying this annotation to a method or
	/// constructor suppresses unchecked warnings about a
	/// <i>non-reifiable</i> variable arity (vararg) type and suppresses
	/// unchecked warnings about parameterized array creation at call
	/// sites.
	/// 
	/// <para> In addition to the usage restrictions imposed by its {@link
	/// Target @Target} meta-annotation, compilers are required to implement
	/// additional usage restrictions on this annotation type; it is a
	/// compile-time error if a method or constructor declaration is
	/// annotated with a {@code @SafeVarargs} annotation, and either:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>  the declaration is a fixed arity method or constructor
	/// 
	/// <li> the declaration is a variable arity method that is neither
	/// {@code static} nor {@code final}.
	/// 
	/// </ul>
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <para> Compilers are encouraged to issue warnings when this annotation
	/// type is applied to a method or constructor declaration where:
	/// 
	/// <ul>
	/// 
	/// <li> The variable arity parameter has a reifiable element type,
	/// which includes primitive types, {@code Object}, and {@code String}.
	/// (The unchecked warnings this annotation type suppresses already do
	/// not occur for a reifiable element type.)
	/// 
	/// <li> The body of the method or constructor declaration performs
	/// potentially unsafe operations, such as an assignment to an element
	/// of the variable arity parameter's array that generates an unchecked
	/// warning.  Some unsafe operations do not trigger an unchecked
	/// warning.  For example, the aliasing in
	/// 
	/// <blockquote><pre>
	/// &#64;SafeVarargs // Not actually safe!
	/// static void m(List&lt;String&gt;... stringLists) {
	///   Object[] array = stringLists;
	///   List&lt;Integer&gt; tmpList = Arrays.asList(42);
	///   array[0] = tmpList; // Semantically invalid, but compiles without warnings
	///   String s = stringLists[0].get(0); // Oh no, ClassCastException at runtime!
	/// }
	/// </pre></blockquote>
	/// 
	/// leads to a {@code ClassCastException} at runtime.
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>Future versions of the platform may mandate compiler errors for
	/// such unsafe operations.
	/// 
	/// </ul>
	/// 
	/// @since 1.7
	/// @jls 4.7 Reifiable Types
	/// @jls 8.4.1 Formal Parameters
	/// @jls 9.6.3.7 @SafeVarargs
