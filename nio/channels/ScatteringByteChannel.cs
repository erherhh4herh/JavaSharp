	/// A channel that can read bytes into a sequence of buffers.

	/// <para> A <i>scattering</i> read operation reads, in a single invocation, a
	/// sequence of bytes into one or more of a given sequence of buffers.
	/// Scattering reads are often useful when implementing network protocols or
	/// file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
	/// or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
	/// <i>gathering</i> write operations are defined in the {@link
	/// GatheringByteChannel} interface.  </para>
